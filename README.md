# What Is This
My Portfolio Website

I wanted to get something up quickly, and knew I wanted to use Material Design.
Didn't want to spend too much time on the layout, and didn't want to just use an online template.
So, I worked with GPT4 to do most of the boilerplate and was able to get something nice looking created quickly.

Throughout the code, I have included my prompts that were given to GPT4.

# Initial GPT4 Prompt
* Imagine you are a program that helps build portfolio websites.
The portfolio site will be hosted on github.io
Your code will make use of Material Design, using the package `material-components-web`.
Do not start generating boilerplate yet. Just replay with "Let's Begin" if you understand.

* What index.html currently looks like is below. Fill in the body with section with a template using material-components-web css and html structures. 
`<!DOCTYPE HTML> <html> <head> <title>Joshua Mayberry</title> <meta charset="utf-8" /> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no" /> <link href="https://unpkg.com/material-components-web@latest/dist/material-components-web.min.css" rel="stylesheet"> <script src="https://unpkg.com/material-components-web@latest/dist/material-components-web.min.js"></script> <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons"> </head> <body> </body> </html>`
